Generating a summary of a dialogue with the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) FLAN-T5 from Hugging Face.
Performed Prompt Engineering comparing Zero Shot, One Shot, and Few Shot inferences. Fine-tuned the model using Full Fine-tuning approach and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics. Absolute percentage improvement of PEFT model over original model was 17.47%.
Used Reinforcement Learning to Generate Less-Toxic Summaries with Meta AI's hate speech Reward Model.
